The mobile website requires a system that will handle all the necessary and
minute details easily and proper database security accordingly to the user. They
require software, which will store data about mobiles like new updates, new
mobile technology launched, Old mobile stocks, second hand phones, and
upcoming technology. This paper explores this gap, and the potential solution to
fill it with the enabling of Mobile Web technologies. The business-to-consumer
aspect of electronic commerce (e-commerce) is the most visible business use of
the World Wide Web. The primary goal of an e-commerce site is to sell goods and
services online. This project deals with developing an e-commerce website for
Online Book Sale. It provides the user with a catalog of different books available
for purchase in the store. In order to facilitate online purchase a shopping cart is
provided to the user. The system is implemented using a 3-tier approach, with a
backend database, a middle tier of Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS)
and ASP.NET, and a web browser as the front end client. In order to develop an e-
commerce website, a number of Technologies must be studied and understood.
These include multi-tiered architecture, server and client side scripting
techniques, implementation technologies such as ASP.NET, programming
